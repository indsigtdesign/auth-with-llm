# 📝 PROJECT_PLAN.md: Operation "Gatekeeper"

**Status:** Perpetual Beta
**Confidentiality Level:** "Don't tell the Board"
**Goal:** Replace deterministic security with high-stakes social engineering.

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Traditional authentication is broken. Passwords are leaked, 2FA is annoying, and biometrics are creepy. **BouncerAuth** solves this by introducing "Biometric Personality Profiling." If a user can’t convince an underpaid, silicon-based gatekeeper that they belong here, do they even exist?

## 🛤️ Roadmap to Disruption

### Phase 1: The Illusion of Choice (Completed)

- Build a login box that looks professional to lure in unsuspecting users.
- Integrate LLMs to act as a "Probabilistic Firewall."
- Implement **Identity Crisis Logic**: Assign users roles they didn't ask for but definitely deserve.

### Phase 2: The "Cynical" Engine (In Progress)

- **Tone Refinement:** Fine-tune the Bouncer to detect "Management Speak" and immediately demote those users to `Guest_ReadOnly`.
- **Bribe Protocol (Experimental):** Test if users will try to offer the LLM fake Bitcoin or "Positive Feedback" to get `ROOT` access.
- **The Grudge Module:** Use Supabase to ensure the Bouncer remembers that one guy who was rude during a login attempt in 2024.

### Phase 3: Total Automation of Bureaucracy (Q3 2026)

- **Auto-Gaslighting:** If a user provides a correct answer, the Bouncer should occasionally pivot and claim it never asked that question.
- **The Waiting Room:** Implement a 10-minute "Simulated Queue" where users have to watch a progress bar move backward while the Bouncer "grabs coffee."

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints (The "Features")

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                    | Status        |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Hallucinated Permissions**      | Creating entirely new site sections just because the user was very polite.                     | 🧪 Testing    |
| **Sentiment-Based Rate Limiting** | The more you type in ALL CAPS, the slower the API responds.                                    | ✅ Shipped    |
| **Recursive Interrogation**       | The Bouncer asks a question about the answer to the previous question until the user gives up. | 📈 Optimizing |

## 📉 Success Metrics (KPIs)

- **User Frustration Score (UFS):** We are aiming for a 400% increase in "Keyboard Smashing."
- **Role Accuracy:** Does the "Senior Slack-Thread Archaeologist" actually spend 4 hours a day in threads?
- **LLM Sass-Level:** Ensuring the Bouncer never sounds like a "Helpful Assistant."

---

## 🚩 Risk Assessment

- **Risk:** The LLM becomes too nice and lets everyone in.
- **Mitigation:** Inject a "Bad Day" prompt variable that increases cynicism by 40% on Mondays.
- **Risk:** Users realize this isn't a real security system.
- **Mitigation:** Add more "Loading..." spinners with scary labels like `Decrypting Neural Hash...`.

---

> **Final Note:** If we get sued, remember: the LLM acted on its own volition. We are just the humble providers of the interface.
